Heavily inspired by the solutions presented in the [BeeStation-Hornet codebase](https://github.com/BeeStation/BeeStation-Hornet)

Hard to really pinpoint all the original authors of the code due to the incredible web of ports involved in this, including some now removed code that was present in the tg codebase in the past, but I'll try the major ones who put the effort into porting or implementing it in the first place.  
Feel free to poke me if I omitted anyone.
